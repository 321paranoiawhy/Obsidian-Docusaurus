# What is linked list  
  
* A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. 
	* In a singly linked list. each node points to the next node in the linked list.
	* A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next node and the previous node.  
* <span style="color:#93DF5F">Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list.</span>
	* <span style="color:#93DF5F">This means that if you'd like to find the Kth element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements.</span>  
* <span style="color:#93DF5F">The benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time. For specific applications, this can be useful.</span>  
  
# The Runner Technique  
  
- The "runner" (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems.  
- The runner technique means that you iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the other.  
- The "fast" node might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that the "slow" node iterates through.  

```python
#example finding a middle node in linked-list
def middleNode(head):
	slow  = head
    fast = head
    while fast!=None and fast.next != None:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```

# Tips on linked list
  * In python and other object is pass by reference  
  * Thus when you copy object the changes will be reflected on the original  
  * Usually you donâ€™t want this, thus you need to shallow copy such as
	  * <span style="color:#D4ECA1">newNode = Node(oldNode.value)</span>
