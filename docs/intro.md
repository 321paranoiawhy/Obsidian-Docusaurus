# How to Become an Expert

- Regular Practice
	- Find a good resource, this can be {teacher, book, website}
		- ex: Use `Leetcode`, competition…
- Get feedback
	- Is the code right or wrong?
	- How fast or slow is it…can it be better?
		- can it be refactored?
	- Compare with other solutions
- Make your next step challenging or new
	- Doing the same things multiple times won't make you an expert
		- Now array questions next should be graph problems
		- Previously medium problems, next should be hard problems
		- Not great on DP questions then more practice on DP questions
