## Note Taking Guidelines

- One heading(#) at the beginning of a file.
	- Nested headings need to be sequential (## > ###)
- Line should start with uppercase
- Image only from remote
- For sequential drop down use numbered bullets -> see docker notes file structure

# How to Become an Expert

- Regular Practice
	- Use Leetcode, competition…
- Get feedback
	- Is the code right or wrong?
	- How fast or slow is it…can it be better?
	- Compare with other solutions
- Make your next step challenging or new
	- Doing the same things multiple times won't make you an expert
		- Now array questions next should be graph problems
		- Previously medium problems now should be hard problems
		- Not great on DP questions then more practice on DP questions
