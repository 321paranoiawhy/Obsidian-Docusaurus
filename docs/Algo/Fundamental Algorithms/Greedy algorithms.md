# Greedy Algorithms

* Greedy algorithms optimize locally, hoping to end up with a global optimum.
* Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so they make good approximation algorithms.
* NP-complete
	* NP-complete problems have no known fast solution.
	* If you have an NP-complete problem, your best bet is to use an approximation algorithm.
