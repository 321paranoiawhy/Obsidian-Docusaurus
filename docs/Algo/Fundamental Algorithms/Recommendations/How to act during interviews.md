# How to Act During Interviews

>  Foremost, During each step explain what you’re doing, every step.

## Make Sure You Understand the Question.

- Explain the question back to the interviewer…this will help you understand the question better

## Create Test Cases Input and Output Tests.

- Write all possible inputs and proper outputs, you can ask the interviewer
	- None, valid, invalid …etc.
- Write the test cases in the main function as TDD

## List All the Possible ways/algorithms You Think Will Solve the Problem

- Start with brute force
- Select other ex: Binary search, DB, two pointers…
	- [Which algo to select, pattern based answer](Algo/Fundamental%20Algorithms/Recommendations/Which%20algo%20to%20select,%20pattern%20based%20answer.md)
- Discuss time complexity analysis
- Select the best/easy based on time/space complexity.

## Draw/Visualize Your solution(approach)

## Code with Pseudo-code Before Going to Actual Solution

- Skip if time is ticking…{you don't want to over explain things}

## Write the Actual Code

## Finally, Run the Test Cases
